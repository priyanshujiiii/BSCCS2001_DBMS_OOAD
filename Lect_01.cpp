// SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
// The order of the day is to refer to software development as spftware engineering.
// Can we really Construct Software as civil engineers build bridges?

// Engineering : Skills of construction
//>> Civil Engineering
//>>>> Construction od buildings
//>> Mechinical Engineering
//>>>> construction of automobiles
//>>Electrical Engineering
//>>>> constructions of power plant
//>>Software engineering
//>>>> Development of software


// Software Development --> Software Construction
// Structural analysis, modeling , Design and Implementation
// Adherence to good practces

// Object oriented analysis & design is a precursor to both:


// Software complexity: understanding the challanges OOAD can addrss
// Object model: Defining the primitives of the OD paradigm
// Classes and objects: Bringing in the boader perspectives
// Classes and objects : Identification approaches using OOAD
// UNIFIED MODEILING LANGUAGE : UNDERSTANDING uml dIAGRAMS (3 WEEKS)
// ooad cASE STUDIES : Applying OOAD in different contacts
